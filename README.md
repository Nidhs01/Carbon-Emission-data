# üåç Carbon Emission Data Analysis

This repository contains curated datasets and tools related to carbon emissions, with a focus on analyzing patterns, visualizing trends, and understanding the impact of different sectors and regions on global carbon output.

## üìÅ Dataset

The main dataset, `data_cleaned.csv`, includes structured and cleaned information on carbon emissions. It may contain fields such as:

  * Country or Region
  * Year
  * CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (in metric tons)
  * Emissions per Capita
  * Sector-wise Emissions (e.g., Energy, Transport, Industry)

## üß™ Applications

This data can support various analytical and visualization projects, including:

  * Time-series trend analysis
  * Cross-country emission comparisons
  * Emissions vs GDP/population correlation studies
  * Data visualization projects (using tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, or D3.js)
  * Exploratory work in climate science, sustainability, and environmental policy

## Key Findings & Recommendations from Data Exploration

Our initial data exploration, detailed in `2_data_exploration (1).ipynb`, has revealed several important insights for further analysis and model selection:

  * **Population count** has been identified as no longer relevant for the analysis and will be removed from the dataset.
  * **CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita** exhibit a strong linear relationship with energy use, while showing nonlinear patterns with other variables.
  * Both **country-specific and overall global trends** in CO‚ÇÇ emissions are observable. Notably, global trends sometimes diverge into different paths for various country clusters.
  * **Outlier groups**, particularly those from the **United Arab Emirates (ARE)**, show distinct patterns that deviate from global trends. These outliers require special consideration during data selection and modeling.
  * Given the **nonlinear nature** of most relationships and the presence of **country-based clusters**, machine learning models capable of handling nonlinearities and grouped data (e.g., Random Forest) are recommended over models suited for purely linear patterns (e.g., Linear Regression).

These findings will guide the subsequent stages of model development and help in building more accurate predictive models for CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
