# üåç Carbon Emission Data Analysis

This repository contains curated datasets and tools related to carbon emissions, with a primary focus on **analyzing patterns, visualizing trends, and understanding the impact of different sectors and regions on global carbon output**. My work within this repository aims to provide insights crucial for environmental sustainability and informed climate action.

## üß≠ Project Overview

This project analyzes global carbon emission trends using machine learning techniques. By transforming raw climate data into actionable insights, it supports environmental policy and sustainability efforts. Tools used include Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Random Forest models. The analysis uncovers nonlinear relationships, country-specific outliers, and sector-wise emission patterns to inform better decision-making.

## üìÅ Dataset

The main dataset I utilize is `data_cleaned.csv`. This file represents a structured and cleaned version of raw information on carbon emissions. It includes key fields that I have prepared for analysis:

* **Country or Region**
* **Year**
* **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (in metric tons)**
* **Emissions per Capita**
* **Sector-wise Emissions** (e.g., Energy, Transport, Industry)

The initial raw data, `climate_change_download_0.xls`, was the starting point for this cleaned dataset.

## üí° Methodology

I followed a systematic methodology to ensure comprehensive analysis and robust model development:

1. **Data Collection and Initial Acquisition:**
   - Acquired raw data from `climate_change_download_0.xls`.
   - Cloned the GitHub repository using:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
     cd <your-repo-name>
     ```

2. **Data Preprocessing and Preparation:**
   - Conducted in `1_data_preparation (1).ipynb`.
   - Cleaned and structured the dataset into `data_cleaned.csv`.
   - Removed irrelevant features like "Population count" to focus on key variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed in `2_data_exploration (1).ipynb`.
   - Found strong linearity between CO‚ÇÇ per capita and energy use.
   - Identified nonlinear patterns and outlier clusters (e.g., UAE).

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Chose **Random Forest** due to its ability to handle nonlinearities and grouped data.
   - Avoided linear models like Linear Regression due to poor fit for the data structure.

5. **Model Development and Training:**
   - Implemented in `3_model_building.ipynb`.
   - Trained Random Forest models with **Cross-Validation (CV)** and **Hyperparameter Tuning (HPT)** for optimal performance.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - While not explicitly detailed in the notebooks, models were likely evaluated using:
     - **R¬≤ Score**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

7. **Prediction and Application:**
   - Enabled time-series forecasting, cross-country comparisons, and emissions vs GDP/population studies.
   - Recommended visualization tools: **Matplotlib**, **Tableau**, or **D3.js**.
